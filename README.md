XMonad Configuration Files
==========================

This is my X11 desktop setup.

Files
-----

* xmobarrc - configuration file for the small [XMonad panel](http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/)
* xmonad.hs - configuration file for [XMonad](http://xmonad.org/)
* Xresources - configuration for X.org
* xsession - startup applications
* uvmeter - small python program which fetches UV radiation rate from
  [arpansa](http://www.arpansa.gov.au/). Australian only. Brisbane is
  currently hard coded, but I might have time to write the whole thing
  in Haskell...

Dependencies
------------

* trayer
